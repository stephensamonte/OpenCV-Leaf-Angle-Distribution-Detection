# OpenCV Leaf Angle Distribution Detection
The goal is to measure Rice Plant Leaf Angle Distribution using images. Leaf Angle Distribution is imporatant as more erect leaves allow the leaves below to have more sunlight which affects the photosynthesis process.

# My Experience / Context
This is my 3rd use of OpenCV for a project. My first attempt with OpenCV was a self Driving Remote Contorl Car and my second project with OpenCV was the HumanDetection Python Program.
